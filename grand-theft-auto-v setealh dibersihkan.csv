8,Mike Williams,  Rockstar Games revisits last year's heist-filled romp with a new version on PS4 Xbox One and PC. With the new power the developer has added more depth and life to the world of Los Santos. It's the same game but the new visual effects and first-person mode provides a strong experience. It's not completely worth a double-dip if you tore through the original GTA V but it's definitely worth a second look.Read full review,16-Nov-14

15,VideoGamer.com Staff,  A beautiful intelligent remaster that is worth double-dipping for.Read full review,19-Nov-14
16,Graham Smith,  The structure of the game helps but GTAV's singleplayer is not simply a case of making the best of a bad situation. I've been surprised over the past week how much I've enjoyed revisiting these storylines and missions after first playing them on XBox 360 at release.Read full review,17-Apr-15

18,Jim Sterling,  Well I already reviewedÿGTA V back in the day I loved it back then and I love it now. Its attempts at clever humor can be embarrassingly misjudged its content is often alarming and I think those who point out the game's problematic elements are perfectly within their right to do so and they're very rarely wrong.Read full review,17-Nov-14

22,Trevor Houston,  Grand Theft Auto V isn't exactly a next gen masterpiece but it is undeniably the undisputed king of open world games. If there is anyone out there that hasn't yet experienced GTA V you owe it to yourself to give it a spin. For those of you who have already taken the journey with Franklin Michael and Trevor there is still plenty of reasons to head back to Los Santos all over again. Trust me this GTA received far more than just a fresh coat of paint.Read full review,19-Nov-14
23,Liam Martin,  While the single-player story campaign remains the same the world in which it takes place is more beautiful than ever so you'll be astounded by the sights all over again.,17-Nov-14
24,Kyle Prahl,  The first-person camera mode does more than change the flow and feeling of play. In Grand Theft Auto V on PS4 every movement and action carries more excitement and meaning. Alongside visual upgrades and content additions this version of Rockstar's masterpiece is can't-miss gaming.Read full review,24-Nov-14
25,Robert Ramsey,  It comes as no surprise that Grand Theft Auto V on the PS4 is the same great game that millions of us have already played but thoughtful additions both big and small mean that it's easily the definitive edition of Rockstar's stellar creation. Los Santos feels more alive than ever and whether you're a frequent visitor or not we'd recommend booking a seat on the next-gen flight if you haven't already.Read full review,24-Nov-14
26,Cyril Lachel,  No matter if you're new to Grand Theft Auto V or a returning player there's more than enough in this next-generation port to keep you satisfied. The first-person perspective manages to make a year-old game feel new again and the changes made to the graphics gameplay and online mode are substantial. One of 2013's best games is made even better on the PlayStation 4.Read full review,16-Nov-14

28,Matt Purslow,  At campaign level you?ll be playing as three distinctly different characters in an astonishingly detailed and accurate recreation of Los Angeles engaging in missions that tips hats to the best in crime cinema. A GTA world has never been as populated with things to do be that hurling yourself out of helicopters whilst riding an ATV or seeking out bounty hunt targets for big cash rewards. Los Santos is a world full of amusement and excitement although these days Rockstar?s satire is starting to wear a little thin and the jokes don?t always hit the right mark. Online it?s the same experience but all the other gangsters are real people. And you can engage in a car chase with a rival player whilst Kenny Loggins? Danger Zone plays on the radio. If that doesn?t convince you I don?t know what will.Read full review,14-May-20
29,Romain Mahut,  When it comes to re-editing an Old Gen game it's natural to fear a lazy porting using better resolution as the only selling point. Rockstar clearly didn't take players for pigeons by relying on the popularity of Grand Theft Auto V. In addition to an in-depth reworked production the publisher reinvents his series by adding a convincing subjective view. It was only a few weeks ago impossible to imagine what Rockstar was planning. A great game. Review in French | Read full review,17-Nov-14
30,Francesco Serino,  There is no doubt about that: GTA V on PC is the definitive version of this beautiful game.

32,Stuart Andrews,  GTA 5 can be depraved amoral sickeningly violent and childishly desperate to shock yet it's also one of the richest and deepest games ever made with an ambitious three-stranded storyline that holds so many disparate parts together.Read full review,17-Nov-15

37,Luke Brown,  The improvements make an already fantastic game that much better and even if you've already run through everything it had to offer it's worth another go. Grand Theft Auto V can now lay claim to not only being one of the best games of its generation but also one of the best remakes as well.Read full review,25-Nov-14
38,Alessandro Barbosa,  Grand Theft Auto V is at home on PC with Rockstar pouring an incredible amount of effort and work into their long overdue PC port. There is simply no better way to experience the branching story in Los Santos - setting a new benchmark on what we can expect from the highest tier of visual fidelity in gaming.Read full review,22-Apr-15
39,Dan Oravasaari,  So if you haven't had a chance to play through GTAV on the PS3 stop reading this and go pick it up as it was one of the best experiences of the last generation and continues to be one this generation. If you're like me and spent an exorbitant amount of time with the game already you may find that the new content will keep you busy for a some time but ultimately itÿwill be a trip down memory lane more than a new lease on life.Read full review,17-Nov-14
40,Timothy Torres,  If you missed out on Grand Theft Auto V the first time around grab it on Xbox One. The first-person mode and graphical boost are well worth the purchase. An already excellent game has turned into a superlative one.Read full review,26-Nov-14

43,Richard Walker,  Over one year on and Grand Theft Auto V is still a stunning unmatched achievement. An open-world that's still utterly absorbing characters that you'll still want to spend time with and enough new stuff to drag you back for more all conspire to make GTA V on new-gen entirely indispensable. Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in.Read full review,17-Nov-14
44,Mehdi Zadnane,  Rockstar's current-generation release of Grand Theft Auto V doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does improve it to a state where we can definitely call if the definitive edition on consoles. Its graphical and gameplay improvements make the game a much better product overall and Rockstar seems to have put a lot of work into this rendition rather than delivering a straight port. It remains to be seen whilst remaining players will want to upgrade to this version but newcomers will definitely be in for a delight. Its only drawback is the fact that GTA Online seems a tad bit lacking at times and doesn't always perform as it should which puts this game at a hair-length from a perfect score.Read full review,24-Nov-14
45,Kevin Mitchell, 2013I've found the narrative in Grand Theft Auto V to be more enjoyable than any of the past Grand Theft Auto games. This time I actually wanted to finish it seeing what happens to all three of the colorful characters. In the previous games I found myself spending way too much time causing chaos in the city but with GTA V Rockstar has included so much content to experience even outside of the main narrative I never felt the need to go full-on Rambo on the city's population. There's also the ambitious online part of the game which could be more addicting than the single-player portion once the game breaking bugs are finally squashed.Read full review,1-Oct-13
46,Nathaniel Stevens,  The visual upgrade to Grand Theft Auto V on the current generation systems would be enough to warrant a re-purchase. It's absolutely stunning and by far one of the best looking games on current gen. The additional online content modes cars people and the inclusion first-person is just icing on the cake. Read full review,17-Nov-14
47,Tommaso Valentini,  If you have never played Rockstar's work this is the perfect time to make it your own and in case you have already experienced old gen different incentives to buy this version too such as new missions new cars new filters and new events could be the stimulus you were waiting for to jump on this next generation open world.

48,Dominic Sheard,  At the end of the day this is stillÿGrand Theft Auto V an entryÿthat I find is the best in the series and a game that has been made that little bit better with the performance boost and graphical enhancements.Read full review,4-May-15
49,Joaby,  The game loads quicker it transitions between characters faster view distances are increased and everything is just better. GTA V on PC is an opera in its honour. It is a sonnet to PC gaming doing what consoles did oh so long ago -- exploiting its strengths and avoiding its weaknesses.Read full review,24-Apr-15
50,Hayden Dingman,  It's clear a lot of legwork went into this PC version from the future-proofed resolution support to the custom-soundtrack support (yes!) to the smooth controls to the amount of tweakable settings to the fact that the game runs.Read full review,14-Apr-15
51,Steve Hannley,  Rockstar has improved upon one of the greatest games of all time. The original version of Grand Theft Auto V was a major accomplishment upon its initial release andÿremains that way even after a year of the new console generation.Read full review,17-Nov-14
52,James Coles,  It's a brilliant entertaining adventure that is worth repeating over and over again you'll never get tired of chasing the American Dream in Los Santos.Read full review,30-Nov-14
53,Matt Walker,  GTA V was a great game last year. Now it's more than just a great game it's damn near perfect and I don't say that about many games. The attention to detail Rockstar has put into this new version is above and beyond what we are used to getting and set a new bar for all other developers out there wanting to re-release a great title on next-gen platforms. If you've never played (hell even if you have) GTA V now's the time to experience all the greatness Rockstar has put into this version. And if you happen to know someone who works for or with Rockstar's development team tell them thank you for this and to get started on remaking Vice City for me!Read full review,17-Nov-14
54,Keith Milburn,  This sharper Grand Theft Auto V doesn't carry any additional moniker ? perhaps signifying the developer's confidence in believing that all versions of their game are the best. That simply isn't true here. These newer versions help realise Los Santos in a way that wasn't possible before and reaffirms Rockstar's skill in producing authentic worlds with a character all their own.Read full review,26-Nov-14
55,SimonPriest,  Having played and reviewed the original release for PlayStation 3 when it launched I can say the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V is no mere port and that Rockstar Games have learned a great deal from their troublesome GTA IV days when it landed on PC. You'd think GTA V had been purpose built for the PC and that's because it has been ? from the generous array of graphics options to native keyboard and mouse support ? Grand Theft Auto V isn't disguised as a PC game it is a PC game.Read full review,20-Apr-15

57,Joffy S,  All in all Grand Theft Auto V is a natural evolution of the series and it does indeed make it seem difficult to comprehend where exactly they can take it next. There's certainly a few areas that could do with some polish but fans of open-worlds will find one of the most accomplished games in years and despite hours and hours spent prodding around I think there's some many secrets still for me to find. One thing's for sure and it's got my appetite whetted for the PC version because once the modding community gets their hands on this it's going to be a joy to see.Read full review,13-Dec-14
58,Roberto Jim‚nez,  Playing GTA V on Xbox One brought me to relive the magnificence of this extraordinary game where you can wreak destruction and mayhem in a huge setting full of traffic policemen pedestrians cats mountain lions deer and coyotes that you can throw into pleasure in escaping the law in any of dozens of luxury cars you buy or steal in the game. If you did not have a chance to play it in the past generation the new version will leave you open-mouthed and if you did it will probably amaze you too although the surprise will quickly fade when you realize that you are doing exactly the same missions. Review in Spanish | Read full review,25-Nov-14
59,"Tony ""OUberLord"" Mitera",  I am hopeful that given time the multiplayer portion will become a better experience. Its status does little to detract from the single-player portion of the game which is finally free from the shackles of console-based hardware. The title is a beauty to behold when it's cranked up all the way and it'll likely run on a pretty wide range of hardware. The PC version may not have any new content but it hits the platform in an extremely polished way. It won't change your mind about the game if you've already played it on another platform but it certainly cements itself as a fantastic version of an entertaining game.Read full review,28-Apr-15

61,Levi van Tine,  The next-gen variety of 'Grand Theft Auto V' is unequivocally a rerelease increasingly common for the gaming industry. However a notable amount of work and care has been put into its development specifically with the first-person mode and this makes for an even better 'GTA V.' As much as I appreciate the first-person mode enhanced graphics and other little things this version is best for those gamers who missed last year's release. It's still one of the best games to be found on the Xbox One.Read full review,1-Dec-14
62,Albert Lichi,  While some of these issues are understandable for the last gen platforms to have there is no excuse for the developer to waste the new hardware's horsepower and release the game running only at 30fps. All the new graphical effects won't mean much in the end if the core gameplay suffers. As far as sandbox crime games go Grand Theft Auto V is an incredible achievement in world building and comes recommended but just don't expect the best action.Read full review,10-Dec-14
63,"Vince ""Moesha"" Massa",  So Grand Theft Auto V finally is available for the PC and thankfully Rockstar took the time to do it right. Taking the additional time to ensure that the game runs smoothly beautiful and fast should make players accept the large amount of time it took for it to be released.Read full review,27-Apr-15

66,Andrei Dobra,  Grand Theft Auto 5 on the new platforms is a great comeback for the already impressive game. The first-person view mode the enhanced visuals and the many different smaller alterations transform the game into an even better experience. However lingering problems with the gameplay and a few visual issues keep it from achieving perfection.Read full review,20-Nov-14
67,Nick H.,  Grand Theft Auto V really surprised me. For a series I have had very little interest in the past outside an appreciate for technical proficiency I found myself drawn into a world where lots of bad things happen to a good number of people - and I was often the one perpetrating these crimes. Call it self-aware social criticism or a guilty pleasure Grand Theft Auto V proves to be a great deal of fun.Read full review,20-Nov-14
68,"Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus",  Grand Theft Auto V for the PlayStation 4 is easily the best version of the game available at the moment. At the end of the day it is still functionally the same game as before with most of the same flaws and strengths. Some new features expand the gameplay a bit including a very cool first-person mode but nothing here will change anyone's opinion of the franchise. Some minor technical flaws including an inconsistent frame rate drag down the game a little but it's largely a step up from the last-gen versions. It's bigger prettier and smoother but it's still GTA5.Read full review,23-Nov-14
69,ThisGenGaming, 2013GTA V was another solid entry into the Grand Theft Auto series I enjoyed the variety of single player story missions the tons of side missions to do as well as all the returning features from San Andreas that got left out of GTA IV. There were some problems for me like textures completely disappearing quite a few times throughout the game which kind of takes you out of that amazing experience and then I also had issues with the police system in the game it got annoying when you'd have a fight or shoot someone in the middle of nowhere and your wanted level would automatically go up but other than that I really enjoyed everything else. Pick up this great game right now and also check back for the GTA Online review next month (Here's a list of Online features confirmed so far to get you excited)Read full review,25-Sep-13
70,Captain Camper, 2013Grand Theft Auto V is the perfect combination of story-telling and excellent game mechanics but most importantly it's one hell of a time. If you're waiting for payday or have yet to pick it up get it. You'll never spend a better $60 in your life.Read full review,20-Sep-13
71,Ben Dutka,  Grand Theft Auto V is a tremendous achievement and that achievement is all the more pronounced on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The inherent cinematic nature of the storyline keeps you riveted and when you're not following the plot you're doing as you damn well please. You're enjoying all that Los Santos has to offer from its sun-drenched beaches filled with people to the bright lights of the downtown area.Read full review,19-Nov-14

73,Kerwin Tsang,  Rockstar delayed the release of the enhanced GTA V on the PC by several months and now that it is released it's easy to see why. In bringing what is essentially a flawless game to the PC they have understood the most important aspect of porting over any console game to the PC: control. The ability for players to control even the most seemingly benign setting of their game is crucial to any decent PC port. Combined with its superior visuals movie making tools and flawless controls Grand Theft Auto V on the PC is with little argument the best way to experience this acclaimed title.Read full review,16-Apr-15

78,Ben Ward,"  I said in my original review that Rockstar dropped the mic on the previous generation with the release of GTAV. If that's the case this feels like a remastering of a classic album. The fact that this isn't known as ""GTAV: Definitive Edition"" speaks volumes to the attitude Rockstar have taken with this release. It's GTAV and it's on the new systems. There is an absolute treasure trove of content to dive headfirst into and with its fresh coat of paint GTAV on PS4 is one of the best looking open worlds that there has ever been on a console. I fully expect the PC version to be modded to the moon and back when it's released in January but for now this version of Los Santos will remain the pinnacle.",1-Dec-14

82,Shawn Zipay,  Grand Theft Auto V doesn't correct every mistake or misstep it made from its previous outing. There are still only three main protagonists in the game all of which are male. The writing is still a bit hit or miss. Aiming and shooting while driving is still an exercise in frustration. However the good aspects of the game far outweigh the bad. First-person mode is a tremendous addition to the game. The increased resolution and stable framerate are fantastic when compared to the old gen. The minimal pop in of objects is leaps ahead of the often-horrendous pop in of objects that often happened right in front of your face on the old gen. Grand Theft Auto V on the PlayStation 4 isn't perfect but it has certainly rekindled my love of the game.Read full review,30-Nov-14
